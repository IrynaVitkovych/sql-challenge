# MODULE 9 sql-challenge
For this module I need to build a SQL database of employees of a corporation called Pewlett Hackard from the 1980s and 1990s. This Challenge is divided into three parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.
To create the sketch for Data Modeling, I used a tool like QuickDBD https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com The results you can find in Data Modeling - ERD folder. 

For Data Engeniring Part: 
- design the Tables: I'll create an appropriate database schema to hold the data from the CSV files. (file: Schema.sql)
- import the CSV Files into a SQL Database: Once the schema is designed, I'll import the data from the CSV files into the corresponding tables in the SQL database.

For Data Analysis Part: 
After importing the data, I can perform various analyses and answer questions next about the data (file: Queries.sql):

1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

2. List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.

3. List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.

4. List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5. List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.

6. List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.

7. List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

8. List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).

Bonus Data Vizualization 

While working on this module, I used Google, Xpert Learning Assistant, Chat GPT, and tutor sessions, which helped me build and run the code.
